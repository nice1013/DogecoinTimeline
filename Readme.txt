Dogecoin timeline is an Excel or Google Spreadsheet file containing list of all the dogecoin events. 


How to Use:

Two Ways:
		
	1) QuickStart ---

	Inside the DogecoinTimeline Folder, there is another file called QuickStart.txt
	
	QuickStart.txt contains a <Iframe> with the most current Dogecoin timeline already set up. 
	
	Copy this to any Html file, and you are ready to go. 




	2) Custom Route --

	Inside the DogecoinTimeline Folder, there is a file called. Links.txt

	Links.txt Contains URLs to publicly available Spreadsheets on the google drive.

	Using One of these Url's, you can customize the timeline by going to 
	'http://timeline.knightlab.com/' and Pasting it into the URL box.

	Below that, there will be your generated Iframe for your timeline. Copy that to your site.
